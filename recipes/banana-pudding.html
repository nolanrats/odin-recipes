    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This banana pudding recipe is sweet, but not too sweet! Perfect for gatherings, parties, 
        celebrations, or just for enjoying on your own. I love banana pudding, and I hope that you do too!
        The blend of crunchy Nilla wafers contrasts with the softness of the pudding and the bananas for a 
        wonderful sweet treat.
